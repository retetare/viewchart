Key Market Trend Patterns Recognized
1. Trend Continuation Patterns
Higher Highs & Higher Lows (Uptrend confirmation)

Lower Highs & Lower Lows (Downtrend confirmation)

Moving Average Alignment (Price above/below EMAs)

Bollinger Band Squeeze (Low volatility before continuation)

2. Reversal Patterns
Break of Structure (Failed HH/Hl or LH/LL)

Divergences (Price vs RSI/MACD)

Exhaustion Moves (Overextensions beyond Bollinger Bands)

3. Consolidation Patterns
Inside Bars (Complete range within previous bar)

Narrow Range (Significantly reduced volatility)

Triangle Formations (Converging highs and lows)

4. Breakout Patterns
Range Breakouts (Above resistance/below support)

Moving Average Crossovers (Fast MA crossing slow MA)

Volume Spikes (High volume confirming breakout)

How the AI Works: A to Z Explanation
A. Data Ingestion
Input Data: The system accepts OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) market data

Timeframes: Works with any timeframe (M1, M5, H1, etc.)

Data Cleaning: Automatically handles missing values and outliers

B. Feature Engineering
Technical Indicators:

Calculates EMAs (20, 50, 200)

MACD, ATR, Bollinger Bands

RSI, ADX for trend strength

Structural Features:

Higher Highs/Lows detection

Breakout/breakdown identification

Consolidation patterns

Candlestick Patterns:
